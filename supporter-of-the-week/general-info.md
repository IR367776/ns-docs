# Supporter of the week

Our systems are not yet perfect. Hence, we need every week to have "TOMEH" which helps the shift if there is problem with are systems.
It helps every member in the mador to know better the systems and also divide the work load of support between the members.  

## TASKS AS TOMEH

- Make sure you have all passwords and accesses needed for full support(Access for shift computer, Azure access to systems, github access to all repos)
- Be available on phone 24/7 (In general shift will call on work hours but we are operational so better to have availability always)
- Don't hesitate to ask for help if you don't know. Ask for help from other members/ people who wrote the systems and head of support(ask nicely of course).
